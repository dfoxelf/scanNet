# scanNet

You always wanted to know which hosts are on your network 
and you don't want to install extra software. So this is a 
small script created for that purpose. 

This script will first create a list of all the populated ips 
within your network, depending on the data you enter. It will 
then try to discover each ip that is being used on your network 
and return the ip and host name.

Feel free to edit, change and even improve this script.

# Once again, I'm not responsible for any misuse of this script.
